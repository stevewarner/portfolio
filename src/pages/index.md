      title: Chord Progression Cheat Sheet
      text: Music theory tool that displays all of the chords in each Mode of the
        Major Scale. This was a project to make it easier to read my own notes
        on the modes. Click on the chord button to hear it play in your browser.

      title: Guitar Chords
      text: React project proof of concept to identify user input as a valid chord and
        display a corresponding chart. The goal is to not hardcode any
        individual chord and just re-use chord shapes. Click on the buttons to
        hear each note of the chord.
